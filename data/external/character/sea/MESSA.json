When a foe with Bleed is defeated, its Bleed stacks are passed on to the foe with the highest HP. He can also spend SP to use Physical skills.\nRipper: When Kitazato uses a skill, inflict 1 Rending stack for every 3 Bleed stacks on the target.\nBleed: Each turn, deal Almighty damage equal to 1% of the target's max HP + Physical damage equal to 4% of Kitazato's Attack. This effect lasts for 4 turns and stacks up to 10 times.\nRending: Deal Physical damage based on Kitazato's Attack and Nightfall's skill level (this damage cannot deal critical hits or Down Point damage).",
