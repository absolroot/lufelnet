  <h2>6. P5X Gacha Pull Tracker (가챠 통계) Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Pull Tracker feature lets you fetch and visualize your P5X gacha history using a user-supplied URL.
    For technical reasons (CORS), the request is proxied via <strong>iant.kr</strong>. The following clarifies what is and is not processed/stored.
  </p>
  <h3>What We Process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The URL you paste (temporary request URL issued by the game) is used only to fetch your gacha history.</li>
    <li>The resulting <strong>gacha history records</strong> (dates, item names/grades) are handled client-side and may be merged for statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>No account identifiers</strong> (e.g., UID/auth key) are stored by this site. The temporary key is not saved on our servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Where Your Data Is Stored</h3>
  <p><strong>Local (in your browser)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We store recent inputs and merged results in browser storage to speed up future visits (e.g., <code>pull-tracker:last-response</code>, <code>pull-tracker:merged</code>, <code>pull-tracker:hide4</code>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Google Drive (optional)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you sign in and choose to sync, the merged history is saved in your <strong>Google Drive AppDataFolder</strong> as <code>p5x_pull_tracker.json</code>.</li>
    <li>We request the minimal scope (<code>drive.appdata</code>) and access only this app-specific file. You can delete it at any time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is used to compute personal statistics (rates, averages, “in progress” pity) and to render charts locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>Aggregated/anonymous statistics may be used for analysis at <a href="https://iant.kr/gacha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iant.kr/gacha</a>. We do not publish personally identifiable information.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How To Delete</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>Clear</strong> button on the Pull Tracker page to wipe local data and request deletion of the Drive file.</li>
    <li>You may also manually remove the file from Google Drive AppDataFolder and clear your browser storage/cookies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Security Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Google sign-in is handled by Google Identity Services. Access tokens are stored only in your browser and are not kept on our servers.</li>
    <li>We do not request access to your general Drive files; only the app’s hidden AppData file is used when you opt-in.</li>
  </ul>
