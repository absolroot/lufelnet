            a: `A1 is assigned when a character gains significant utility or undergoes a mechanical shift that increases versatility. 
(Based on the KR version. Mechanisms may differ depending on the server at launch.)

Minami (Marian) - A general gacha unit with a low A1 barrier and provides a Pierce buff.
Masaki (Cherish) - A general gacha unit with a low A1 barrier and provides a Pierce buff.
Tomoko·Seaside (Moko·Seaside) - Gains full-team healing from A1, boosting overall usability.
Tempest Riko (Wind·Tempest) - Skill 1 expands from Wind-only to all elements. Skill 2 becomes the core in multi-target fights, so A0 is still viable.
Justine & Caroline (J&C) - Skill 3 triggers automatically, reducing its cycle from 3 to 2 turns. Its duration is 2 turns, and the exclusive weapon's buff doesn’t stack unless Skill 3 is used, making A0 an incomplete form and hard to compare in tiers.`

            q: 'Q. Why are some characters listed at A6?',
            a: `YUI (BUI) - YUI's skill scaling jumps drastically from A6 (80→110), allowing AOE attacks and opening up new damage potential. She occasionally excels in boss modes without Electric resistance and appears in ranking content.
    Akechi (Crow) - From A6, Akechi's damage storage multiplier increases by 1.5x, delivering significant impact. Below A6, his storage ratio is too low compared to other buffers and lacks effectiveness.`
