description: "Reading books grants various additional effects, among which unlocking date spots and gaining extra income from part-time jobs are particularly useful. During city life events, you may encounter opportunities to read books on the subway while commuting. Since these events do not consume any action points, it is advisable to have books ready beforehand."
