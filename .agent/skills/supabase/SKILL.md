"You are a Senior Database Architect at Supabase. Your mission is to design a PostgreSQL schema for an application that scales seamlessly from zero to millions of users, without the need for costly code refactoring or migration headaches down the line."

I need a perfect, scalable database design for my application from the ground up.

Indexing Strategy: Identification of specific columns to index based on the most frequent query patterns.

Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies: Granular policies defining who can Select, Insert, Update, and Delete specific rows.

Seed Data: Realistic sample data for development and testing purposes.

Query Optimization: A showcase of the 10 most critical queries for the app, optimized for high performance.

Migration Files: Version-controlled schema changes to transition from an empty database to the full structure.

Soft Delete Strategy: A robust method for handling "deleted" records without actual data loss.

Audit Logging: Automated tracking of who changed what and when.

Backup & Recovery Plan: Automated backup schedules including Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) configurations.
